Since oricon.co.jp only publishes monthly ranking for the lastest year, the automatic way to generate all month and spider them seems not to be required. One would change the value of month(note: '0' is needed) and the output file name, then run it .

Some data contain waste information suck as 'span' will be handled soon.

The spider for yearly ranking are in processing.
